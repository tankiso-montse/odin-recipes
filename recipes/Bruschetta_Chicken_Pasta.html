    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>If you like a good, rustic bruschetta...you're gonna love this pasta dish with pan-seared chicken. The freshness of the tomatoes, basil, and garlic will leave your family wanting more!</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <h3>- Chicken:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>3 boneless skinless chicken breasts, sliced in half horizontally</li>
        <li>1 cup Italian salad dressing</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>- Bruschetta:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>8 Roma tomatoes, seeded and chopped</li>
        <li>6 basil leaves, chopped, or more to taste</li>
        <li>1 head garlic - cloves separated, peeled, and chopped</li>
        <li>1/3 cup balsamic vinegar</li>
        <li>1/3 cup olive oil</li>
        <li>salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>- Pasta:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 pound angel hair pasta</li>
        <li>1/3 cup vegetable oil</li>
        <li>1 yellow onion, chopped</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Place chicken, Italian dressing, garlic powder, 1 teaspoon salt, and 1 teaspoon black pepper in a resealable plastic bag; seal the bag and squeeze gently to coat chicken. 
            Place chicken in the refrigerator to marinate for 15 minutes or up to 4 hours. </li>
        <li>Add Roma tomatoes, basil, garlic, olive oil, and balsamic vinegar to a large bowl and mix well. Season to taste with salt and black pepper.</li>
        <li>Heat vegetable oil in a cast iron skillet over medium-high heat. Remove chicken from marinade and add to the skillet. Cook until chicken is golden brown and juices run clear, 
            5 to 7 minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer, inserted near the center, should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Discard marinade.</li>
        <li>Remove chicken from the skillet. Set aside to cool slightly, then slice into bite-sized pieces.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook angel hair pasta in the boiling water, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, 4 to 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Remove excess oil from the skillet; add the 2 tablespoons olive oil to the skillet, and cook and stir yellow onion until translucent, 3 to 4 minutes. Stir in bruschetta mixture; cook for 3 to 4 minutes. Remove from heat.</li>
        <li>Drain pasta. Toss pasta with bruschetta, top with cooked chicken, and serve.</li>

    </ol>
